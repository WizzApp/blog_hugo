My name is Daniel Rosendorf. I write software for a living. Lately I’ve been finding joy in setting up builds and build pipelines as well as writing tests and generally making it easier for developers to setup and join new or existing projects.

Outside of work I’m husband to a lovely wife and constantly working on driving her crazy. I’m also father of 2 (soon to be 3) children which in turn try to drive us crazy :-). I also practice Jiu Jitsu and besides that I try to find time for writing even more software, reading fantasy and science fiction books and spending time with my family.
