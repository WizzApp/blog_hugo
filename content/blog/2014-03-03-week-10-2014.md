# What the ... ?

So the weekend was nice and I had time to think a little bit about this blog and my (practically) non-existent blogging habit. I want to change that, so here is what I am going to do:

Every monday I am going to write up a list of up to three goals (work or at least somewhat computer related to stay relevant for my also non-existent readers ;-) and will try to keep or reach them during the week.

The next thing the monday posts will also contain are a review of the past week and its goals. Obviously the monday posts will not be written when I am on vacation etc. but I will keep those posts as constant as possible (hear, hear! ;-)

So, enough babbling, on to the goals for this week.

# The goals

1.  Write a blog posts about my must-have tools setup as a reference for any future computer setups I have to do (inspired by [this post](http://mattanjakern.de/2014/02/must-have-software-tools/) of a good colleague of mine). This will not be a complete list of everything, but I'll start with the essentials and extend it in the future.
2.  I also want to try and create a little prototype for side project (can not talk about this too much as it is kind of secret, but at least I can mention it here).

So, that's it for this week. Now I challenge myself to keep those goals and next monday we will see how I did ... have a nice week!
