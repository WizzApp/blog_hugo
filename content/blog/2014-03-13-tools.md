As I said [last week](/blog/2014/03/03/week-10-2014) I am going to talk a little bit about the tools I currently use/have installed on my dev machine. "Tools" in this case meaning almost everything, from languages/compilers to actual utilities and powershell scripts.

And to be honest, this is more for my own benefit as I need to keep track of all that so that I can rebuild it if necessary.

This will be just a list with links to the corresponding blog posts (or whatever) that helped me set the software up, so do not expect too much.

Here we go ...

# Command line

I am a fan of the command line interface. Not a wizard, but a fan. So here is a short overview over my setup:

1.  [Cmder](http://bliker.github.io/cmder/) as a host for my standard Powershell console.
2.  [msysgit](http://msysgit.github.io/*). The only true SCM ;-) in its official windows version.
3.  Powershell (of course) with some custom scripts and extensions in my profile:

    * [find-to-set-alias](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/12/find-to-set-aliasps1.html) to set various aliases for Visual Studio and Sublime Text.
    * [PsGet](http://psget.net/)
    * [PowerShell Community Extensions](http://pscx.codeplex.com/)
    * [posh-git](http://dahlbyk.github.io/posh-git/)
    * I also have a line with a call to vcvarsall.bat in my PS profile:

      ```
      Invoke-BatchFile "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
      ```

      This makes msbuild et al available so I can build most VS solutions from the shell as well.

    * Also ssh-agent is started when I start a Powershell session as described in [this post](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/12/19/get-git-for-windows.aspx/) by Phil Haack.

4.  [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). More or less the apt-get of the windows world ;-)
5.  [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/). Write C# like it is a scripting language. Nice to play around with.

# Languages

1.  .NET Framework (and various corresponding SDKs, of course).
2.  [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/). For all the JS development that I never come around to.
3.  [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). You are not hip anymore without Ruby. Install with the [RubyInstaller for Windows](http://rubyinstaller.org/).
4.  [Python](http://www.python.org/). Nothing to say here.

# IDEs

1.  Visual Studio
2.  [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). I use that one for everything I do not use VS for ;-)

That is all for now, but I am almost positively sure that I missed something, so I will very probably update this post in the future.
