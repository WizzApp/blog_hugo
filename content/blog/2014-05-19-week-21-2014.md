Ok, it has been a while since my [last weekly post](/blog/2014/03/24/week-13-2014). What happened? Well, work happened, as always. Also something big changed in my personal life. In between there was another [ELO](http://elo.com/) training which kept me busy for a whole week and now there are introductions into a new (old) project. So, now review this time because I actually do not really remember the work done in the last view weeks. But the goals are still here ;-).

# The goals

1.  There will be blog post this week. A good colleague of mine and me talked about a little architectural solution and I want to test that out. And I will not keep the results or the process to myself.
2.  Finish a very little project (a windows service with self-hosted web to control status and run jobs). This will probably end up in a blog post too ;-).
3.  Do some work.

On this note: Of to do some work, have a nice week!
