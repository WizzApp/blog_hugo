## TL;DR;

I've been coding in C# for more than 10 years now and last week I realized that I feel at home in this language. I feel comfortable in the language, but strangely I do not feel comfortable with this feeling itself ;-)

## What's been happening

For the last few weeks I've been involved in a project customizing a DMS for a customer. This customization is mostly done in a strange combination of Java and JavaScript. After a few weeks of coding, I had an excuse to work with C# again and this felt like seeing the day after a very long night. I feel at home when I'm coding C#. Maybe that's because of the almost 10 years of experience I have in that language. But this also made me think. It's time to learn something new, to increase the size of my comfort zone.

## The list

So here are a few things I want to delve into in the near and not so near future:

* [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)  
  A quite new language based on Erlang/OTP which should make it the perfect language to implement a web API. The idea is to use the [Ã‰tudes for Elixir](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001642) ebook as an outline for the exercises to get into the language. The solutions will be available on the my corresponding [repository](https://github.com/WizzApp/EtudesForElixir) on Github.

* [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io)  
  A new JavaScript client framework developed [Rob Eisenberg](http://twitter.com/@EisenbergEffect) which looks very nice. The [Get Started Guide](http://aurelia.io/get-started.html) should provide a pretty good introduction.

Other things on the list include flexbox layouts (which should also help me get into CSS in general ;-), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [OAuth 2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) and [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/).

That should pretty much keep my from being bored outside of my day job, so let's see how this works out.
