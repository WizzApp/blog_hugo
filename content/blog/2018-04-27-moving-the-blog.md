Short update: I'm moving away from using Octopress and my own virtual server to build and host this blog. Instead from now on I will be using [Wyam](https://wyam.io) to build and [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host it. Comments will be powered by Github or more exactly [utterances](https://utteranc.es).

Why? I realized that I do not need the infrastructure of a whole virtual server to host this blog. If I want a server to host a project I can use one hosted in the cloud and spun up on demand. This reduces costs and makes it easier for me to actually blog (hopefully ;-)). 

Using utterances allows me to host comments to blog posts on Github which should not be a problem, considering that the main audience of my blog are supposed to be developers. And Netlify has its own CDN. Together with code hosting on Github this is basically an instant win for me ;-).
